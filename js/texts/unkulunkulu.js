            text: `UNKULUNKULU is no longer known. It is he who was the first man; he broke off in the beginning. We do not know his wife; and the ancients do not tell us that he had a wife.

We hear it said, that Unkulunkulu broke off the nations from Uthlanga (the original source, the reed from which all things sprang).

The old men say that Unkulunkulu is Umvelinqangi, for they say he came out first; they say he is the Uthlanga from which all men broke off.

The old men say that Unkulunkulu is; he made the first men, the ancients of long ago; the ancients of long ago died; there remained those who had been begotten by them, sons, by whom we hear that there were ancients of long ago who knew the breaking off of the world.

They did not know Unkulunkulu; they did not see him with their eyes; they heard it said that Unkulunkulu was. He came out where men broke off from Uthlanga. He begat the ancients of long ago; they died and left their children; they begat others, their sons, they died; they begat others; thus we at length have heard about Unkulunkulu. It was our ancestors who told us the accounts of Unkulunkulu and of the ancients of long ago.

What we know is this: men sprang from Unkulunkulu, as if he made them because he existed before them. This is what we know.`

            text: `It is said Unkulunkulu sent a chameleon; he said to it, "Go, Chameleon, go and say, Let not men die."

The chameleon set out; it went slowly; it loitered in the way; and as it went, it ate of the fruit of a tree, which is called Ubukwebezane.

At length Unkulunkulu sent a lizard after the chameleon, when it had already set out for some time. The lizard went; it ran and made great haste, for Unkulunkulu had said, "Lizard, when you have arrived, say, Let men die."

So the lizard went, and said, "I tell you, It is said, Let men die."

The lizard came back again to Unkulunkulu, before the chameleon had reached his destination, the chameleon which was sent first; which was sent, and told to go and say, "Let not men die."

At length the chameleon arrived and shouted, saying, "It is said, Let not men die!"

But men answered, "O! we have heard the word of the lizard; it has told us the word, 'It is said, Let men die.' We cannot hear your word. Through the word of the lizard, men will die."

Thus death came to mankind through the slowness of the chameleon and the swiftness of the lizard. This is why, to this day, when the Amazulu see a chameleon, they curse it, saying, "You are the cause of our dying, because you loitered on the way!"`

            title: 'The Amatongo: Ancestor Spirits',
            text: `Tell me if at the present time there are any who pray to Unkulunkulu?

There are none. They pray to the Amatongo; they honour them that they may come and save them.

Who are the Amatongo?

The Amadhlozi, men who have died; when they have died, they change again and become Amatongo, and crawl on their belly, and so the old men call a dead man so changed an Itongo. It is called a snake; Inyandezulu is the name of the snake.

Unkulunkulu gave men Amatongo; he gave them doctors for treating disease, and diviners; he gave them medicines to treat diseases occasioned by the Itongo.

Unkulunkulu said, "If a man is being affected by the Itongo, you shall kill a bullock and laud the Itongo; the man will get well if he has been affected by the Itongo."

He said, "You will see also by night, you will dream; the Itongo will tell you what it is it wishes." He said, "It will also tell you the bullock it would have killed."

The Itongo dwells with the great man; he who dreams is the chief of the village; it says "Should you kill a bullock, the man will get well." The bullock which the Itongo mentions is killed; and although people were thinking that the man would die, he gets well; and so it is clear that the man was affected by the Itongo.`

            text: `The gall-bladder is taken from the bullock, and the man has the gall poured on him; they give praise and say, "In order that we may see that it is the Itongo, let us see him get well this very day; and at the very dawn of tomorrow eat meat; so we shall see that it is the Itongo. On the other hand, we shall not admit in our hearts that it is the Itongo; we shall say, it is disease only; there is no Itongo in his body. If we see that it is the Itongo, we shall see it by his getting well, and so we shall give thanks. Then we will kill many cattle, and laud the Itongo, and see that the Itongo of our house is good."

When a man is ill, they go to a doctor to divine; the diviner comes and tells them to eat a bullock. And they eat a bullock, the diviner saying that the man will get well.

If when they have eaten the bullock he does not get well, but dies, they say, "He is summoned by those who are beneath." They say, "He has been killed by the Amadhlozi because they wish the man to go and dwell with them."

When anyone dies among black men, they lament very much and make a great noise. And when he is buried, all his things are taken, and a large fire kindled to burn them; not a single thing which he wore on his body is left; all is burnt, for they are afraid to wear the property of a dead man.`

            text: `When a man is ill, they enquire of diviners; and it is said, "The Amatongo have come to ask for cattle, that a bullock should be killed." The flesh of the slaughtered bullock is put together in a hut, that the Amatongo may eat; the door is shut, and the people do not eat the meat at the time, but on the morrow.

In the evening boys sleep in the hut and watch the meat. In the morning the flesh is boiled, and men assemble to eat the head. They then separate and go to their own villages; and those of the family where the bullock has been killed remain. Then the breast is boiled, which will be eaten by the chieftainesses and by the people of the family.

All the bones of the bullock are collected, and the owner of the cattle burns them, that wizards may not take them, and apply medicines to them and injure the man who was sick, and he become ill again.

When they slaughter cattle, they first praise the snake, and then the bullock is killed. When it is killed they skin it; and a little of the fat is taken, and put in the upper part of the hut on a sherd; and fire is placed on it. When the flesh of the bullock burns, the Amatongo eat (if they do come to eat the flesh of a bullock).

But when we ask, "What do the Amadhlozi eat? for in the morning we still see all the meat," the old men say, "The Amatongo lick it." And we are unable to contradict them; but are silent, for they are older than we, and tell us all things, and we listen; for we are told all things, and assent without seeing clearly whether they are true or not.`

            title: 'The Snake of the Ancestors',
            text: `When a snake comes into a house it is not killed; they say, "It is the Idhlozi of So-and-so," mentioning the name of a man who is dead; it is said the snake came out of him at his death. It is left, and remains always in the house. They take a goat and sacrifice it, sacrificing to the snake. No one sees it when it goes away.

When black men are on a journey they honour the snake. When a man is injured and gets well, he kills a bullock, for he thanks the Idhlozi, thinking that it has saved him. When a man obtains cattle also, he thanks the snake, thinking it is the snake which has given him many cattle.

A man whose father is dead, when he is about to kill a bullock, worships his father, praying him to look on him continually, and give him all that he wishes, and give him cattle and corn—every thing.

If a man is endangered by a snake and escapes, he gives thanks, saying, "It was the Idhlozi of my father which came to visit me, and did not wish to harm me, but only to greet me."

Thus the snake is sacred among the Amazulu, for it is seen as the form which the ancestor takes when he returns to visit the living.`

            text: `In the speech of black men, when a man does a wonderful thing which other men cannot do, or brings a bad matter to a good issue, men say, "Au! go to! the people of Unsondo do thus."

Or if the heaven rains excessively great torrents, and causes wonder, it is also constantly said, "How the heaven of Unsondo rains!"

And of the earth also, if it is hard to dig, it is said, "Au! how hard it is, the earth of Unsondo!"

Besides also, if there is a very handsome man, whom people like to make a wonder, they say, "Au! how beautiful he is, a man of Unsondo."

So finally we hear that Unsondo is, as it were, a man by the saying which is used, "Unsondo died uttering this his last word, 'Those are men because they are so and so.'"

Therefore we say that this Unsondo is the same as Unkulunkulu, who, we say, died. It is he indeed, and not another.

It was said at first before the arrival of missionaries, if we asked, "By what were the stones made?"—"They were made by Umvelinqangi." It is said that we men came out of a bed of reeds, where we had our origin.

When we asked, "By what was the sun made?" they said, "By Umvelinqangi." For we used to ask when we were little, thinking that the old men knew all things which are on the earth; yet forsooth they do not know.`

            title: 'Uthlanga: The Source of Being',
            text: `The Ibakca tradition speaks of Uthlanga as the origin of all:

When asked, "Who sent the chameleon?" they replied, "By Unsondo."

"And who was he?"

"He was he who came out first at the breaking off of all things (ekudabukeni kwezinto zonke)."

"Explain what you mean by ekudabukeni."

"When this earth and all things broke off from Uthlanga."

"What is Uthlanga?"

"He who begat Unsondo."

"You do not mean then a reed, such as those in that bed of reeds in the valley?"

"No; but Uthlanga who begat Unsondo."

"Where is he now?"

"O, he exists no longer. As my grandfather no longer exists, he too no longer exists; he died. When he died, there arose others, Unsondo who were called by other names. Uthlanga begat Unsondo; Unsondo begat the ancestors; the ancestors begat the great grandfathers; the great grandfathers begat the grandfathers; and the grandfathers begat our fathers; and our fathers begat us."

"Are there any who are called Uthlanga now?"

"Yes."

"Are you married?"

"Yes."

"And have children?"

"Yebo. U mina e ngi uthlanga." (Yes. It is I myself who am an uthlanga.)

"Because you have become the father of children?"

"Yes; I am an uthlanga on that account."

Thus every father is himself an uthlanga—a source—for his children, just as Uthlanga was the source of all things in the beginning.`

            title: 'The Question of Worship',
            text: `But for my part I say they speak truly who say that Unkulunkulu is named Umvelinqangi. But as for what they say respecting his having a wife, I have not heard of it. What I have heard is this, that men sprang from Unkulunkulu, as if he made them because he existed before them; it was not said that Unkulunkulu had a wife. This is what we know.

And as regards worship, they speak truly who say, he was not worshipped. For it is not worship, when people see things, as rain, or food, such as corn, and say, "Yes, these things were made by Unkulunkulu."

But no such word has come to them from him as this, "I have made for you these things that you might know me by them." He made them that men might eat and see them and nothing more.

Afterwards they had power to change those things, that they might become the Amatongo's. They took them away from Unkulunkulu.

So the ancients did not worship Unkulunkulu; they worshipped only the Amatongo—the ancestors who were nearer to them in time and memory. For Unkulunkulu was too old, too far away in the mist of time.

But the Amatongo were known. They had names. They had families. They could be called upon and would answer. Thus the worship of ancestors replaced the memory of the First One.`

            title: 'Wisdom of the Elders',
            text: `These are things spoken by the old ones, passed down from generation to generation:

On the Mystery of Life:
"We do not know where Unkulunkulu went. It is said he died. But we do not know where he died, nor where his grave is. He is lost to us."

On the Origins:
"All things that are, came from Uthlanga. The sun and the moon, the stars and the earth, the rivers and the mountains—all broke off from that first source. And so did we. We are all children of Uthlanga."

On the Ancestors:
"Honor your father and your mother while they live. Kill cattle for them when they are sick. And when they die, remember them. For they become your Amatongo, and they watch over you still."

On Death:
"Do not curse the chameleon, though he brought us death. For death itself is not the end. We become the Amadhlozi, and crawl beneath the earth, and speak to our children in dreams."

On the Living and the Dead:
"The dead are not gone. They are in the rustling grass. They are in the snake that enters the hut. They are in the wind that moves the trees. They watch us. They protect us. They live in us."

These are the teachings of the Amazulu, kept alive in the hearts of the people.`
