            text: `1. O MY SON, write this First Book, both for Humanity's sake, and for Piety towards God.

2. For there can be no Religion more true or just, than to know the things that are; and to acknowledge thanks for all things, to Him that made them, which thing I shall not cease continually to do.

3. What then should a man do, O Father, to lead his life well; seeing there is nothing here true?

4. Be Pious and Religious, O my Son; for he that doth so, is the best and highest Philosopher, and without Philosophy it is impossible ever to attain to the height and exactness of Piety and Religion.

5. But he that shall learn and study the things that are, and how they are ordered and governed, and by whom, and for what cause, or to what end. Will acknowledge thanks to the Workman, as to a good Father, an excellent Nurse, and a faithful Steward, and he that gives thanks shall be Pious or Religious, and he that is Religious shall know both where the truth is, and what it is, and learning that he will be yet more and more Religious.

6. For never, O my Son, shall, or can that soul, which, while it is in the body, lightens and lifts up itself to know and comprehend that which is good and true, slide back to the contrary. For it is infinitely enamoured thereof, and forgetteth all evils; and when it hath learned and known its Father and Progenitor, it can no more apostatize or depart from that good.

7. And let this, O Son, be the end of Religion and Piety; whereunto thou art once arrived, thou shalt both live well and die blessedly, whilst thy soul is not ignorant wither it must return, and fly back again.

8. For this only, O Son, is the way to Truth, which our Progenitors travelled in; and by which making their journey, they at length attained to the good. It is a venerable way and plain, but hard and difficult for the soul to go in that is in the body.

9. For first must it war against its own self, and after much strife and dissention, it must be overcome of the part; for the contention is of one against two, whilst it flies away, and they strive to hold and detain it.

10. But the victory of both is not like, for the one hasteth to that which is Good, but the other is a neighbour to the things that are Evil; and that which is Good desireth to be set at liberty, but the things that are Evil love bondage and Slavery.

25. Firstly, God; secondly, the World; thirdly, Man.

26. The World for Man; Man for God.

27. Of the Soul; that part which is sensible is mortal, but that part which is reasonable is immortal.

28. Every Essence is immortal.

29. Every Essence is unchangeable.

30. Everything that is, is double.

37. The mind in God.

38. Reasoning in Man.

39. Reason in the Mind.

40. The Mind is void of suffering.

44. Nothing good upon Earth; nothing evil in Heaven.

45. God is good; Man is evil.

46. Good is voluntary, or of its own accord.

47. Evil is involuntary, or against its will.

80. What is God? The immutable or unalterable good.

81. What is man? An unchangeable evil.

82. If thou perfectly remember these Heads, thou canst not forget those things which in more words I have largely expounded unto thee; for these are the contents or Abridgment of them.`

            text: `MY THOUGHTS being once seriously busied about things that are, and my Understanding lifted up, all my bodily Senses being exceedingly holden back, as it is with them that are heavy of sleep, by reason either of fulness of meat, or of bodily labour: Methought I saw one of an exceeding great stature, and of an infinite greatness, call me by my name, and say unto me, What wouldst thou hear and see? Or what wouldst thou understand to learn and know?

2. Then said I, Who are Thou? I am, quoth he, Poemander, the mind of the great Lord, the most mighty and absolute Emperor: I know what thou wouldst have, and I am always present with thee.

3. Then I said, I would learn the things that are, and understand the nature of them, and know God. How? said he. I answered that I would gladly hear. Then said he, Have me again in thy mind, and whatsoever thou wouldst learn, I will teach thee.

4. When he had thus said, he was changed in his Idea or Form, and straightway, in the twinkling of an eye, all things were opened unto me. And I saw an infinite sight, all things were become light, both sweet and exceeding pleasant; and I was wonderfully delighted in the beholding it.

5. But after a little while, there was a darkness made in part, coming down obliquely, fearful and hideous, which seemed unto me to be changed into a certain moist nature, unspeakably troubled, which yielded a smoke as from Fire; and from whence proceeded a voice unutterable, and very mournful, but inarticulate, inasmuch as it seemed to have come from the Light.

6. Then from that Light, a certain holy Word joined itself unto Nature, and outflew the pure and unmixed Fire from the moist nature upwards on high; it was exceeding Light, and sharp, and operative withal.

8. Then said Poemander unto me, Dost thou understand this vision, and what it meaneth? I shall know, said I. Then said he, I am that Light, the Mind, thy God, who am before that moist nature that appeared out of darkness; and that bright and lightful Word from the mind is the Son of God.

9. How is that, quoth I? Thus, replied he, understand it: That which in thee seeth and heareth, the Word of the Lord, and the Mind the Father, God, differ not one from the other; and the union of these is Life.

18. But the Father of all things, the Mind being Life and Light, brought forth Man like unto himself, whom he loved as his proper Birth; for he was all beauteous, having the image of his Father.

26. And from this cause Man above all things that live upon earth is double: Mortal, because of his body, and Immortal, because of the substantial Man. For being immortal, and having power of all things, he yet suffers mortal things, and such as are subject to Fate or Destiny.

34. And man was made of Life and Light, into Soul and Mind; of Life the soul, of Light the Mind.

50. God and the Father is Light and Life, of which Man is made. If therefore thou learn and believe thyself to be of the Life and Light, thou shalt again pass into Life.

52. God saith, Let man, endued with a mind, mark, consider, and know himself well.

68. And then being made naked of all the Operations of Harmony, it cometh to the Eighth Nature, having its proper power, and singeth praises to the father with the things that are, and all they that are present rejoice, and congratulate the coming of it.

69. And then in order they return unto the Father, and themselves deliver themselves to the Powers, and becoming Powers they are in God.

70. This is the Good, and to them that know, to be desired.

86. Holy is God, the Father of all things.

87. Holy is God, whose will is performed and accomplished by his own powers.

88. Holy is God, that determineth to be known, and is known by his own, or those that are his.

89. Holy art thou, that by thy Word has established all things.

90. Holy art thou, of whom all Nature is the Image.

91. Holy art thou, whom Nature hath not formed.

92. Holy art thou, that art stronger than all power.

93. Holy art thou, that art stronger than all excellency.

94. Holy art thou, that art better than all praise.

98. Therefore I believe thee, and bear witness, and go into the Life and Light.

99. Blessed art thou, O Father; thy man would be sanctified with thee, as thou hast given him all power.`

2. God, and the Mind, and Nature, and Matter, and Operation or Working, and Necessity, and the End, and Renovation.

3. For there were in the Chaos an infinite darkness in the Abyss or bottomless Depth, and Water, and a subtle Spirit intelligible in Power; and there went out the Holy Light, and the Elements were coagulated from the Sand out of the moist substance.

4. And all the Gods distinguished the Nature full of Seeds.

5. And when all things were interminated and unmade up, the light things were divided on high. And the heavy things were founded upon the moist Sand, all things being Terminated or Divided by Fire, and being sustained or hung up by the Spirit, they were so carried, and the Heaven was seen in Seven Circles.

6. And the Gods were seen in their Ideas of the Stars, with all their signs, and the Stars were numbered with the Gods in them. And the Sphere was all lined with Air, carried about in a circular motion by the Spirit of God.

7. And every God, by his internal power, did that which was commanded him; and there were made four-footed things, and creeping things, and such as live in the water, and such as fly, and every fruitful seed, and Grass, and the Flowers of all Greens, all which had sowed in themselves the Seeds of Regeneration.

8. As also the Generations of Men, to the Knowledge of the Divine Works, and a lively or working Testimony of Nature, and a multitude of men, and the dominion of all things under Heaven, and the Knowledge of good things, and to be increased in increasing, and multiplied in multitude.

11. And every Generation of living Flesh, of Fruit, Seed, and all Handicrafts, though they be lost, must of necessity be renewed by the renovation of the Gods, and of the Nature of a Circle, moving in number; for it is a Divine thing that every worldly temperature should be renewed by Nature; for in that which is Divine is Nature also established.`

3. There is one name or appellation of Nature or Increase, which concerneth things changeable, and another about things unchangeable, or which are not subject to change.

4. And every soul, made of Life and Light, if it shall learn and know that it is made and composed of Life and Light, it shall return again into the same.

5. But if the soul cannot know itself, and know that it is from Life and Light, it is driven about in darkness by evil passions.

6. The soul enters into the body, and the body is thus made perfect by the soul; for when the soul leaveth the body, the body by itself becometh a carcass.

7. The mind is from the substance of God; the soul is from the substance of the Mind; the body is formed from the elements.

8. The Mind containing the soul, and the soul the body, makes the man perfect and works the whole work in man.

9. Whither goeth the Mind when it leaveth the body? It goeth into that whence it came.

10. For that which is divine in us, which knoweth itself, knows also its own source.

2. But do thou contemplate in thy mind, how that which to many seems hidden and unmanifest, may be most manifest unto thee.

3. For it were not at all, if it were not manifest; for whatsoever is manifest, was made or generated. But that which is unmanifest ever is; for it needs not to be made manifest, since it ever is.

4. And He makes all other things manifest, being unmanifest, as being always, and making other things manifest; Himself is not made manifest. Himself not generated, yet in phantasie representeth all things, and in generation.

5. For generation is of that which is created, or made; for generation is but the apprehension and manifestation of that which was not manifest.

6. Who therefore is God? That Maker of all things. Or who is the Father? He that was not generated; Or who is God? The good, and that which makes all things. Or what is man? Evil.

2. And if it be so, it must be an Essence or Substance, void of all motion and generation, but having an energy without a beginning, working with itself, always like itself, and equal, and always good.

3. Now this cannot be found in any other; for it is not in evil, for evil is subject to want, which is a species of corruption; nor is it in generation or making, for generation or making is imperfect. Therefore search no farther, for there is no other thing in which Good may be found besides God alone.

4. For whatsoever else is called good is by comparison only; for the things that are compared are then called by comparison that which they are.

5. Good therefore is not worldly; and therefore neither is the World good.

6. What is God? An infinite Power; what is Man? An evil thing.

7. Good is in nothing but in God alone; for the World is ever moved, carrying with it sickness as its companion, and corruption grows from sickness; and therefore neither is the World good.

2. Trismegistus: O Son, the matter is in us, but not corporeally; but we ourselves do hinder the entrance of the truth. 

3. Therefore the Generation of understanding doth not come from the will or desire of man, but at the good pleasure of God.

4. Tat: Is there then, O Father, some manner of soul in being yet without understanding?

5. Trism.: Speak thou with godly reverence, son. The soul is not in man, but it is the Mind.

6. The Mind is in the soul, the soul is in the body; and the body is in the World.

7. Therefore the soul is a Divine thing, being immortal, and placed in a mortal body.

8. Regeneration, O Son, is a birth, not of seed, but of the will of God; for it is not a thing that is taught, nor is it the effect of any Element, but from the grace of God.

9. Therefore I say that the regeneration is not accomplished by the Elements, but by the will of God.

3. For the malice of ignorance surroundeth all the Earth, and corrupteth the soul, shut up in the body, not suffering it to arrive at the Havens of Salvation.

3. For they which are of creeping things, are changed into those of watery things; and those of things living in the water, to those of things living upon the Land; and Airy ones are changed into men.

4. Human Souls, that lay hold of immortality, are changed into holy Daemons.

5. And so they go on into the Sphere or Region of the fixed Gods; for there are two choirs or companies of Gods, one of them that wander, and another of them that are fixed; And this is the most perfect glory of the Soul.

7. But being drawn back the same way, it falleth into creeping things.

8. This is the punishment of an evil Soul. And the wickedness of a Soul is ignorance.

9. For the Soul that knows nothing of the things that are, neither the nature of them, nor that which is good, but is blinded, rusheth and dasheth against the bodily passions, and unhappy as it is, not knowing itself, it doth serve strange Bodies, bearing the Body as a burden.`

2. Therefore, O Lord, make it clear unto me; for I shall believe thy demonstration of these things.
