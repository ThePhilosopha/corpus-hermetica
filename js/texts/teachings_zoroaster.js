"Make thyself pure, O righteous man! Any one in the world here below can win purity for himself, namely, when he cleanses himself with Good Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds."

PRAYER OF ASHEM-VOHU
(From Khordah-Avesta)

1. "Purity is the best good.
2. "Happiness, happiness is to him:
3. "Namely, to the most pure in purity."

THE LAW OF AHURA-MAZDA

"The law of Mazda cleanses the faithful from every evil thought, word, and deed, as a swift-rushing, mighty wind cleanses the plain.

"So let all deeds thou doest be henceforth good. A full atonement for thy sin is effected by means of the law of Mazda."`

            text: `The sage asked the Spirit of Wisdom thus: "How is it possible to seek maintenance and prosperity of the body without injury of the soul, and the preservation of the soul without injury of the body?"

The Spirit of Wisdom answered thus: "Him who is less than thee consider as an equal, and an equal as a superior, and a greater than him as a chieftain, and a chieftain as a ruler. And among rulers one is to be acquiescent, obedient, and true-speaking; and among accusers be submissive, mild, and kindly regardful.

"Commit no slander; so that infamy and wickedness may not happen unto thee. For it is said that slander is more grievous than witchcraft.

"Form no covetous desire, so that the demon of greediness may not deceive thee, and the treasure of the world may not be tasteless to thee.

"Indulge in no wrathfulness, for a man when he indulges in wrath becomes then forgetful of his duty and good works, and sin and crime of every kind occur unto his mind, and until the subsiding of the wrath he is said to be just like Ahareman (the Destructive Spirit).

"Suffer no anxiety, for he who is a sufferer of anxiety becomes regardless of enjoyment of the world and the spirit, and contraction happens to his body and soul.

"Commit no lustfulness, so that harm and regret may not reach thee from thine own actions.

"Bear no improper envy, so that thy life may not become tasteless.

"Practice no sloth, so that the duty and good work, which it is necessary for thee to do, may not remain undone.

"Choose a wife who is of character, because that one is good who in the end is more respected.

"Thou shouldst be DILIGENT and MODERATE, and EAT OF THINE OWN REGULAR INDUSTRY, and provide the share of the sacred beings and the good; and thus the practice of this in thy occupation is the greatest good work.

"With enemies fight with equity. With a friend proceed with the approval of friends. With a malicious man carry on no conflict, and do not molest him in any way whatever. With a greedy man thou shouldst not be a partner, and do not trust him with the leadership. With an ill-famed man form no connection. With an ignorant man thou shouldst not become a confederate and associate. With a foolish man make no dispute. With a drunken man do not walk on the road. From an ill-natured man take no loan.

"In forming a store of good works thou shouldst be diligent, so that it may come to thy assistance among the spirits.

"Thou shouldst not become presumptuous through any happiness of the world; for the happiness of the world is such-like as a cloud that comes on a rainy day, which one does not ward off by any hill.

"Thou shouldst not become presumptuous through much treasure and wealth; for in the end it is necessary for thee to leave all.

"Thou shouldst not become presumptuous through great connections and race; for in the end thy trust is on thine own deeds.

"Thou shouldst not become presumptuous through life; for death comes upon thee at last, and the perishable part falls to the ground."`

            text: `When the soul departs from the body, it is questioned by the angels of Ahura-Mazda concerning its deeds in the world.

If it has been righteous, it is led by a beautiful maiden across the Chinvat Bridge—the Bridge of Judgment—into the eternal light of paradise.

If it has been wicked, the bridge becomes narrow as a razor's edge, and the soul falls into the abyss of darkness.

For three days and three nights the soul hovers near the body, and on the fourth day it goes to the place of judgment. There it meets either the good angel Sraosha or the evil demon, according to its deeds.

The righteous soul is met by a fragrant wind and a beautiful form—the form of its own Good Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds made manifest.

The wicked soul is met by foul odors and a hideous form—the form of its own evil made manifest.

Thus each soul is judged by its own actions, and receives according to what it has given.`

Let the One like Thee declare it earnestly to the friend who is such as I, thus through Thy Righteousness within us to offer friendly help to us, so that the One like Thee may draw near us through Thy Good Mind within the soul.

"This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright: how, in pleasing Him, may we serve the Supreme One of the better world?

"This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright: who by generation was the first father of the Righteous Order? Who gave the recurring sun and stars their undeviating way? Who established that whereby the moon waxes, and whereby she wanes, save Thee? These things, O Great Creator! would I know, and others likewise still.

"This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright: who from beneath hath sustained the earth and the clouds above that they do not fall? Who made the waters and the plants? Who to the wind has yoked on the storm-clouds, the swift and fleetest too? Who, O Great Creator! is the inspirer of the good thoughts within our souls?

"This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright: who, as a skilful artisan, hath made the lights and the darkness? Who, as thus skilful, hath made sleep and the zest of waking hours? Who spread the Auroras, the noontides and midnight, monitors to discerning man, duties, true guides?

"This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright, that I may ponder these which are Thy revelations, O Mazda! and the words which were asked of Thee by Thy Good Mind Within us, and that whereby we may attain, through Thine Order, to this life's perfection. Yea, how may my soul with joyfulness increase in goodness?

"This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright that holy faith which is of all Things best, and which, going on hand in hand with Thy people, shall further my lands in Asha, Thine Order, and, through the words of Aramaiti (our piety), shall render actions just.

"Reveal to me the rules of thy law!"

PRAYER OF KE VERETHREM GA

"Who is he who will smite the fiend in order to maintain thy ordinances? Teach me clearly thy rules for this world and for the next, that Srosh (Angel who fights Drug with an uplifted Club, and guards the Earth Night and Day) may come with Vohumano and help whomsoever thou pleasest."

PRAYER OF ORMUZD YAST (In Praise of God)

"And he who in this material world, O Spitama Zarathustra! shall recite and pronounce those names of mine either by day or by night;

"He who shall pronounce them, when he rises up or when he lays him down; when he binds on the sacred girdle or when he unbinds the sacred girdle; when he goes out of his dwelling-place, or when he goes out of his town, or when he goes out of his country and comes into another country;

"That man, neither in that day nor in that night, shall be wounded by the weapons of the foe who rushes with anger and is Drug-minded;

"But those names shall come in to keep him from behind and to keep him in front, from the Drug unseen, from the evil-doer bent on mischief, and from that fiend who is all death, Angro Mainyus."

GOD AS THE KING, THE LIFE, THE REWARDER

"Praises, and songs, and adorations do we offer to Ahura-Mazda, and to Righteousness the Best; yea, we offer and we ascribe them, and proclaim them.

"And to Thy good kingdom, O Ahura-Mazda! may we attain for ever, and a good King be Thou over us; and let each man of us, and so each woman, thus abide, O Thou most beneficent of beings, and for both the worlds!

"So mayst Thou be to us our life, and our body's vigour, O Thou most beneficent of beings, and that for both the worlds!

"Aye, let us win and conquer long life, O Ahura-Mazda! in Thy grace, and through Thy will may we be powerful. Mayst Thou lay hold on us to help, and with salvation, O Thou most beneficent of beings!

"What reward most meet for our deserving Thou hast appointed for the souls, O Ahura-Mazda! of that do Thou bestow on us for this life, and for that of mind. Of that reward do Thou Thyself grant this advantage, that we may come under Thy protecting guardianship, and that of Righteousness for ever."`

First, the sky was created, luminous and manifest, with its ends afar, made of shining metal.

Second, water was created, and the seas were formed.

Third, the earth was created, broad and without hills, for hills and mountains came later through the movement of the stars.

Fourth, plants were created, first growing in the middle of the earth.

Fifth, cattle were established, the first of the useful animals.

Sixth, mankind was created, first Gayomart, the primal man.

For each good creation of Ahura-Mazda, Angro Mainyus (the Destructive Spirit) created a corresponding evil. Where Ahura-Mazda created life, Angro Mainyus brought death. Where there was truth, he brought the lie. Where there was light, he brought darkness.

But the victory of Good over Evil is assured, for in the end Ahura-Mazda shall prevail, and all creation shall be renewed and purified by fire, and the dead shall rise, and all shall live forever in the light of eternal truth.`

"He who sows corn, sows righteousness; he makes the law of Mazda walk; he suckles the law of Mazda as a mother suckles her child a hundred times, a thousand times ten thousand times."

HAPPINESS OF THE EARTH

"It is the place whereon one of the faithful steps forward, the Holy Word in his mouth, the way prepared, with fuel in his hands, with the Baresman in his hands, with milk in his hands, with the mortar in his hands, faithfully obeying, with a mind intent on righteousness."

ON TEMPERANCE

"Eat not to fullness; drink not to drunkenness; for from too great eating comes disease; from too much drinking comes death.

"Moderation in all things is the best good. The wise man is he who knows when to stop."

ON LOAN

"If a man gives a thing to his neighbor, and the neighbor says it is his own, the first man shall take an oath, and the thing shall be returned to him.

"But if a man borrows and does not return, it is theft. Let him make restitution and pay a fine, for the borrower is bound by his word."

ON RELIGIOUS EDUCATION

"Parents are bound to teach their children the hymns and prayers of the faith, that they may grow in righteousness and walk in the path of Asha (Truth).

After drinking the sacred wine and entering a deep sleep for seven days and nights, his soul was led by Srosh and Atar to the Chinvat Bridge.

There he saw the souls of the righteous crossing with ease, for the bridge was wide and pleasant for them. They were met by beautiful maidens—the forms of their own good deeds—and led to paradise.

He saw the paradise of the righteous: a place of infinite light, sweet fragrances, and eternal joy. The souls there wore garments of light and sat upon golden thrones, forever praising Ahura-Mazda.

He also saw the punishments in hell: darkness, foul odors, and terrible suffering for those who had practiced evil in the world. The liars, the adulterers, the murderers, the worshippers of demons—all received fitting punishment for their sins.

And Arda-Viraf saw those in the middle place between heaven and hell—those whose good deeds and evil deeds were exactly equal. They suffered neither reward nor punishment, but waited in twilight.

When Arda-Viraf returned to his body, he related all that he had seen, that men might know the truth and choose the path of righteousness.`
